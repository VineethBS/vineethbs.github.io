\textbf{Baseband channel modelling}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A baseband channel can be modelled as an LTI low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of $f_{c}$. The channel can be modelled as introducing attenuation, noise, ISI, and unknown propagation delay leading to synchronization issues. Your task is to write a Matlab function which can model a baseband channel.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume in the following tasks that signals are sampled at a frequency $f_{s}$.
\item Write a Matlab \emph{channel} function that takes as input a sampled signal $x[n]$ and produces an output $y[n]$ which is a delayed version of $x[n]$; the delay (in number of samples) should be an input
\item Modify your channel function to introduce additive white Gaussian noise into $y[n]$. The variance of additive white noise should be an input into the function.
\item Modify your channel function to also low-pass filter the input $x[n]$; the low pass filter should have a gain $g$ in the passband as input, and a passband cutoff frequency of $f_{c}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Plot the frequency and phase response of the channel that you have modelled for your choice of channel parameters.
\item Can you comment on how you would use the above approach to model an actual channel? That is, you would need to describe how this model is fit to an actual channel.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Passband channel modelling}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A passband channel can be modelled as an LTI band-pass filter with a passband of $[f_{p,1}, f_{p,2}]$. The channel can be modelled as introducing attenuation, noise, ISI, and unknown propagation delay leading to synchronization issues. Your task is to write a Matlab function which can model a passband channel.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume in the following tasks that signals are sampled at a frequency $f_{s}$.
\item Write a Matlab \emph{channel} function that takes as input a sampled signal $x[n]$ and produces an output $y[n]$ which is a delayed version of $x[n]$; the delay (in number of samples) should be an input
\item Modify your channel function to introduce additive white Gaussian noise into $y[n]$. The variance of additive white noise should be an input into the function.
\item Modify your channel function to also band-pass filter the input $x[n]$; the low pass filter should have a gain $g$ in the passband as input, and a passband of $[f_{p,1}, f_{p,2}]$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Plot the frequency and phase response of the channel that you have modelled for your choice of channel parameters.
