<h2>Comments to students doing B.Tech project/internship with me</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>These are comments that would be applicable to students at some point during their project/internship duration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Come to the lab regularly. At the time that you are doing a project, you are almost out of college and preparing to go for a job. Treat the project work duration as a a job. Anything that can get you fired from a job (ask parents<i>elder siblings</i>relatives/seniors) can also lead to non-satisfactory performance in the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talk about your project to the other students in the lab - especially the PhD students and project students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attend weekly meetings with your supervisor (that is me). Even if you have not done anything during the last week, please do not hesitate to meet. Meeting slots may vary from week to week due to other commitments that I have, so be around in the lab (see the second point).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn Beamer<i>LaTeX. All slides</i>documents should be prepared in Beamer/LaTeX. Do not use online latex editors such as overleaf.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare one slide (in Beamer) which describes what you have done in a week when meeting me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn Git and use it for version control of your source code - maintain a local repository or host it on github. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn to use a vector graphics program (such as inkscape). Prepare figures using this software.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to properly plot 2D scatter, line, and bar plots. Talk to me to find out how to do this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
