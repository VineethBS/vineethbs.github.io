<h2>Comments to students doing B.Tech project/internship with me</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Attendance and Weekly meetings</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are required to be in the department or lab from 0900 to 1700 hrs on all working days. Regular attendance is a component of your final project grade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will most probably have weekly meetings with me (a schedule would be set up during the beginning of the semester). You have to attend these meetings without fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare one slide (in Beamer) which describes what you have done in a week when meeting me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even if you have not done anything during a week, please do not hesitate to meet. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Please note that meeting slots may vary from week to week due to other commitments that I have, so be around in the lab (see the first point).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please note that if you are absent for an extended amount of time (such as due to illness) then you may be asked to extend your project duration (this will mean that your graduation will be postponed by at least 1 year) or you may be allowed to finish with a lower grade.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>On how you do your work?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain a notebook recording the work done during your project. Bring this to all meetings without fail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talk about your project to the other students in the lab - especially the PhD students and project students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn Git and use it for version control of your source code - maintain a local repository or host it on github. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn to use a vector graphics program (such as inkscape). Prepare figures using this software.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to properly plot 2D scatter, line, and bar plots. Talk to me to find out how to do this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to use a spell checker and use it to check your writeups and report.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please re-read your writeups and reports before submitting it to me. You should have done at least two editing passes before submitting writeups and reports to me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to manage your time. Write down what all tasks you need to do each week, break it up into tasks for a day and do this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will be asked to write up what you have read or what you have done at several points during the course of your project and when making your report. <b>At no time, you should plagiarise (copy) any material</b>. If this happens at any time, then you would never get S grade and you would be penalized appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help should be acknowledged. For example, if someone helps you with writing some code, then acknowledge this in your report.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All slides and/or documents should be done in Beamer/LaTeX. Do not use online latex editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>You are required to monitor your email regularly (at least once a day)</b>. You can give me the preferred contact email address at the start of the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Do not fudge data so that it looks good</b>. You have to realize that anything wrong that you are observing would either indicate some problem with the setup or code that you have written which needs to be fixed or would be something that requires thought. </p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Grading for your project work</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the time that you are doing a project, you are almost out of college and preparing to go for a job. Treat the project work duration as a a job. Anything that can get you fired from a job (ask parents/elder siblings/relatives/seniors) can also lead to lower grade in the project as well as disciplinary action from the institute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I expect that you do your best during the project work. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Please note that I will recommend an S grade only if you have put in a lot of hard work as well as produce a work of significance - such as a paper, software etc. You should also have a lot of initiative and try to come up with ideas, proper explanations etc. The final grade that you receive will depend on the outcome of the grading procedure that the department uses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if you are irregular in your work do not expect a grade more than C grade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
