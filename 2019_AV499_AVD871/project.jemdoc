= Applied Markov decision processes & Reinforcement Learning (AV499 & AVD871)

== Points to note
~~~
- The class project is a team project for students who are crediting the course
- The team size should be 3
- The class project carries 20 marks and will be averaged with the internal marks (also of 20 marks)
- The project can be of the following types
	-- Picking a research paper in Markov decision processes and Reinforcement learning from the options given below (see below for how to choose a paper), writing a report on the paper. and giving a presentation on the main ideas in the paper. Implementation and reproduction of the results in the paper would carry additional credit.
	-- Picking a software framework or library which is used for Markov decision processes and Reinforcement learning, writing a tutorial article on this with a novel example, giving a tutorial presentation on the use of the software. See a list of options below.
	-- Proposing your own research idea or implementation project in the field of stochastic control (MDP) and Reinforcement learning, writing up a research proposal,and writing up a research paper or making a demonstration on this idea (please note that there is no extra credit for this and this is highly risky as far as marks are concerned). Please discuss with the instructor.

== Research paper options
~~~
- Please note that there are multiple sources of papers on MDPs and RL
- It is recommended that each team should choose three to four papers of your interest from the options given below and discuss with the instructor, and then fix a paper for the project
